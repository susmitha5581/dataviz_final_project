The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find... 

**"I really love the Olympic Games season. It is one of my favorite times of year. Many athletes become heroes for generations, standing up for their nations and, more importantly, setting an example and inspiring future generations of athletes."**
