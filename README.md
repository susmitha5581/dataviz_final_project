The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find... 

**"I really love the Olympic Games season. It is one of my favorite times of year. Many athletes become heroes for generations, standing up for their nations and, more importantly, setting an example and inspiring future generations of athletes."**

**Through this data visualization, we can learn more about players, teams, sports, age and gender.**

**Project 1 data visualization:** 

*Sport is one of the most powerful platforms for promoting gender equality, let's see Males and Females participated in Olympics according to their Age.*

**There are more male athletes at the Olympics, so the medal count is higher for male athletes than for female athletes**


## Project 02

By far the most notable benefits are improvements in cardiovascular fitness and muscular endurance. Other less commonly publicized positive effects are weight loss and mental health changes such as improvement in mood, self-esteem, reductions of anxiety and relationship bonding with training partners.

from here you can find the code of the project 02 

[Marathon_finishers](https://github.com/susmithareddy-1996/dataviz_final_project/blob/main/data/marathon_results_2017.csv), This is the data set what I used

**Sample data visualization:** 

*I enjoyed when I practice the Spatial vizualization, here you can see my favourite visualization in project 02*

## Project 03

In this project, I explored ...**Visualizing Text and Distributions**

*In order to visualize distributions, histograms are commonly used. Bins show the frequency of values in data by grouping them into intervals or classes of equal size (i.e., intervals or classes) you can obtain a sense of the distribution of your quantitative data quantitative data.*


*Graphs, charts, or word clouds are methods of representing written data in a visual manner using text visualization. An instant look at the most relevant keywords in a text provides a quick summary of content, reveals trends across documents, and summarizes content across a wide range of documents.*



**My favourite density Plot**

### Moving Forward

_add here a short reflection on what you learned and what you plan to continue exploring in terms of data visualization, data storytelling, reproducible research, and/or related topics_
